# About the course
## Harvard - CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

## Syllabus

<b>Search</b><br/>
Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move.

<b>Knowledge</b><br/>
Representing information and drawing inferences from it.

<b>Uncertainty</b><br/>
Dealing with uncertain events using probability.

<b>Optimization</b><br/>
Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better—or the best—way to solve it.

<b>Learning</b><br/>
Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience.

<b>Neural Networks</b><br/>
A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.

<b>Language</b><br/>
Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans.
